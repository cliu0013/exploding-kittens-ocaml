The modules for this game do not require outside libraries.

1. Run [make clean] to delete any old files generated from previous runs.

2. Run [make build] to generate the OCaml build. 

3. Run [make play] to start the game. 

4. The terminal will prompt you to enter a number for the number of AI players.
   Type in an integer number from 1 to 5, inclusively. Then hit [enter].
   
   The terminal should now display your initial hand that contains 
   1 Defuse and 7 non-Bomb cards.

6. The terminal will now prompt you to play your turn. To use a card, simply 
   type in that card's name, or type in [Pass] to end the turn and draw a card. 
   All inputs are case sensitive. Then hit [enter]. 

   If your decide to draw a card but your mistyped the card name, a new prompt 
   would be popped to ask you input something new and reprint your hand.
   If you use a card in your hand, it will be no longer in your hand. 
   If you pass the turn and draw a card, the AI players will draw cards and 
   pass the turn back to you. 

   When it's your next turn, you will notice there is a new card in your hand 
   if you didn't draw a card. If you draw a bomb, you will be bombed and 
   lose the game. You will draw a bomb sooner or later. 
   We don't have the mechanism to let you win the game for this demo currently, 
   sorry. 

7. Enjoy :)

** All printed command lines with "TEST ONLY" will be commented out 
   for the final game.
